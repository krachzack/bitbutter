Aeons after life has left every last planet in our solar system, the sun itself is finally ready for its well earned retirement. This means that there is going to be a job vacancy in the extraterrestrial environment. Our sun has to be replaced. It needs a successor, obviously.

"Applicants are required to have several millenia of professional experience as a (semi-)habitable planet."

"Simple enough." - the planets thought to themselves and sent in their application letters. Since it is a great honor to become the next sun in a solar system, the space authorities had way too many applicants. Thus, a form of competition had to be invented. Only the best may shine bright for (almost) eternity.

In order to become a sun, a planet has to collect the energy of hundreds of stars, so that it can harness their light energy. Cleverly, the space authorities decided to pit the planets against one another in a star collecting competition. Furthermore, they threw a few black holes into the mix, that, when touched, will rob a planet of its light energies before disappearing itself. Lastly, they granted the planets the power over temporal magic. Through this, the planets learned to sling forth a blast of concentrated temporal energy, that will throw a planet back in time if it hits one.

"Let the battles begin." - they said and watched as the planets charged into the fray.
